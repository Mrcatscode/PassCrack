# PassCrack
PassCrack (funny name i know) is an educational tool to tech other about the use of password crackers so that they may find a way to protect themselves from other attempting to use tools like this one for maliciousnsess


PassCrack is still in progress so it is not very powerful right now but i am trying to add
. A way to pick if/where to click to start typing for both the password and username areas
.A way to pick an RBG value and a spot on the screen to detect a succesful password and then save the last 5 passwords
.A way to add priority passwords/make passwords to use first
